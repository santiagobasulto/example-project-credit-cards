# Credit card applications

In this project you will create a model to predict if an credit card application should be approved or not.

To train our model you will be using the the [Credit Card Approval dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval) from the UCI MAchine Learning Repository.
